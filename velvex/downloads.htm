  - Added ShowXLIcons option to show XL-Icons in vsxThumbs mode
    (it will only work on WinXP).
  - Added ShellExtractExtensionsList to selectively load shell
    supported thumbnails.
    Suppose you only want images + html thumbnails, then you 
    should turn off seShellExtract to disable the extraction of
    additional shell supported files (doc, xls, etc) and then 
    add '.html' to the ShellExtractExtensionsList.
  - Mouse wheel will now scroll by thumbnail height.
  - New IDE component palette icon.

  - Fixed AV when the RootFolder is renamed and the cache
    saving is activated.
  - Added UseSubsampling property to resize the thumbnails
    smoothly without loss of image quality.
  - Added Compressed property to the Cache options, it activates
    the on-the-fly cache compression system. VELVEx uses JPEG
    compression because it's the most effective compression method
    for images, the drawback is that there's a loss of quality in the 
    thumbnails, if you are looking for the highest quality rendering 
    deactivate this property and set UseSubsampling to true.
    Here are some tests on a folder with 200 images 
    (120 x 120 thumbnails):
      No compression: 7205 Kb, 0% compressed
      ZLib: 5002 Kb, 30% compressed
      JPEG: 441 Kb, 94% compressed
  - Lossless Compression for small images.
  - Greatly improved thumbnails rendering speed.
  - Reduced flicker when scrolling.
  - Updated Demo.

  - Fixed an AV on WinXP, changed SupportsShellExtract.
 
20 May 2003 - version 1.3
  - Added Stretch property to the thumbnail options, it
    stretches the thumb images to fit the thumbnail size.
  - Fixed incorrect drag image offset, thanks to Jim.
  - Fixed drag images not showing on WinXP, thanks to Jim.
  - Fixed incorrect mouse state when opening the context menu,
    thanks to Jim.
  - Fixed thumbnail renaming bug, when the file extension was
    changed the thumbnail was not refreshed.
  - Made a workaround of a TListview bug, when the Listview is
    small enough to not fit 2 fully visible items the PageUp/PageDown
    buttons don't work.
  - Fixed thumbnail creation bug, the images were shrinked if
    the thumb size was higher than the image size.
  - SyncItemsCount was not called when the items were deleted.
  - Fixed Details drawing in Win9x.
  - Fixed a bug in MakeThumbFromFile, TJPEGImage doesn't accepts
    images with 1 pixel width or heigth, the minimum size of the
    thumbnails is now set to 2.
  - Fixed a bug in ValidateListItem, it didn't work for the first
    node in the list.
  - Fixed a bug in the Drag&Drop mechanism, it now doesn't allow
    to drop in the dragged item unless the right button is used
    for the drag operation or when Ctrl, Alt, Shift keys are being
    pressed.
    The same goes for dropping in the background.
  - Fixed a bug in the Drag&Drop mechanism, it didn't accept 
    items outside the listview unless Ctrl, Alt or Shift keys was
    pressed.
  - Fixed a bug in the thumbnails cache saving mechanism, thanks
    to Eric Fookes for pointing this out.
 
7 April 2003 - version 1.2
  - The cache is automatically updated when loaded. If an image
    file was changed the thumbnail will be reloaded.
  - Added DetailedHints property to the thumbnail options to show a
    hint including file name, size, date, type, image size, and
    shell icon. ShowHint must be true.
  - Added OnThumbsGetDetails event to set a customized string for
    the hints and thumbnails details.
  - Fixed mem leak in MakeThumbFromFile for using StretchDraw,
    which is not thread safe.
  - Fixed a bug in the Drag&Drop mechanism, now it doesn't allow to
    drop a file if the shell doesn't support it.
  - Fixed the drawing of the multiple Drag&Drop bitmap.
  - Fixed a TListview bug, in virtual mode when the icon arrangement
    is iaLeft the arrow key press are scrambled.
  - The Bevel and Border properties are now correctly synched.
  - Demo updated.
 
27 February 2003 - version 1.1
  - Added OnThumbThreadClass event, to replace the thumbnail
    thread with a custom one, thanks to Jim for implementing this.
  - Added a new demo to showcase how to create a custom thumbnail
    thread.
  - Fixed an incorrect parameter in OnThumbsCacheAdd event.
 
17 February 2003 - version 1.0
  - Added UseShellExtraction property, it is used to let the shell
    extract and create the thumbnail. Jim added support for
    IExtractImage in the Thumbnails thread. HTML files, and most 
    image files and any other format that is supported by windows or
    a shell extension is shown as a thumbnail!
    VELVEx will try to create the thumbnails with the image library,
    if that fails and UseShellExtraction is enabled it will try
    with the Shell IExtractImage interface.
    I decided to leave the image files to the default image library
    based on some tests:
    With a folder of 180 jpg files:
      Windows Explorer (IExtractImage): ~20 secs.
      ACDSee: ~10 secs.
      VELVEx: ~5 secs.
    Cache file size:
      Windows Explorer: ~1000 KB
      ACDSee: unknown
      VELVEx: ~270 KB
  - Regrouped the thumbnails properties into ThumbOptions property
  - Added ValidateListItem public method to get a valid TListitem
    associated with a Node. 
    The obtained ListItem gives you access to its properties and
    methods, which will be sensible to use only when the ViewStyle
    is not in vsxReport, for example:
    var
      L: TListItem;
    begin
      if LVEx.ValidateListItem(LVEx.FocusedNode, L) then
        L.MakeVisible(false);
    end;
  - Added LoadAllAtOnce property to load all the thumbnails at once,
    like ACDSee.
  - Added ExtensionsExcludeList public property, is a list that 
    contains the file extensions that should be excluded from creating 
    the thumbnails.
    This could be helpfull when you don't want the shell to create
    thumbnails for a specific file extension.
  - Added BorderSize property to set the thumbnails border width.
  - Added ShowSmallIcon property to show the file small icon on the
    top-right border of the thumbnails.
  - OnEnter and OnExit events are now triggered correctly.
  - Fixed a bug in the cache deleting method, when AutoLoad was true
    and the thumbnail was reloaded, the cache was getting scrambled.
  - Fixed a bug in the editing method, in Win9x if the Delete key was
    pressed an AV was raised.
  - Fixed a bug in the editing method, when an item was reselected
    after the control was unfocused the item enters in edit mode.
    It's a classic TListview bug.
  - Minor bug fixes.
  - Demo updated.
 
29 December 2002 - version 0.9.9
  - Fixed minor selection and focus issues, thanks to Boris.
 
19 December 2002 - version 0.9.8
  - Added a chance to change the items caption via DoGetVETText,
    thanks to Jim for implementing this.
  - Added ThumbsHighlight, ThumbsHighlightColor properties to
    control the image files highlighting.
  - Fixed a bug in TExtensionsList, it was not filled correctly
    in Delphi 5.
  - Fixed a bug in CreateNewFolder, it was giving an AV when the
    ViewStyle was not vsxReport.
  - Fixed a bug in the painting method, items were not properly
    blended and cut items were not ghosted.
  - Fixed a bug when Align and Constraints were setted at runtime
    and the ViewStyle wasn't vsxReport it didn't worked as expected.
 
7 December 2002 - version 0.9.7
  - Reworked the cache mechanism, improved thumbnails creation and
    painting speed.
  - Added new public method for cache cleaning, 
    ThumbsCacheOptions.ClearCache
  - Added new public method for cache item reload, 
    ThumbsCacheOptions.Reload
  - Added new property, ThumbsCacheOptions.CompressionQuality, 
    to control the thumbnail compression, default value of 60

    CustomDrawing of the M$ Listview, it slows everything down, 
    don't know how the heck  Win Explorer manages this
    behavior).
	 
19 July 2002 - version 0.6 (Jim Kueneman)
  - Added the long awaited Drag and Drop Support.  Please be
    careful with this as it seems ok but if you delete you 
    hard drive I take no responsibility. 
    The drag image sucks but I spent all the time on TListview
    I am going to trying to get it to create a better drag image,
    it won't because of the custom draw and no image lists assiged
    to the control (don't try to assign a image list with custom 
    draw either!).
  - Fixed bug with the new FNodeArray when the VT structure
    change was detected and VLVEx called SyncItemsCount.
    This method would change the number of items in the 
    Listview but did not check to see if FNodeArray was big enough.
