Silverpoint MultiInstaller can help you install all the component packs in just a few clicks.
Just download the zips and select the destination folder, all the components will be uninstalled from the IDE if they were previously installed, unziped, patched, compiled and installed on the Delphi IDE.
It also supports C++Builder 2006 and above.

The customizer demo has been improved to support unicode localization, unfortunately the translations are not complete:

ar (Arabic):            100% translated (Ammar I)
de (German):             73% translated (Thomas Speck)
es (Spanish):           100% translated (Robert Lee)
fi (Finnish):            73% translated (Tapio Saarikumpu)
fr (French):             73% translated (Bob Baudewyns)
ja (Japanese):          100% translated (Minoru Yoshida)
ko (Korean):            100% translated (Hyeonwoo Oh)

tr (Turkish):            73% translated (Zylar)
zh_CN (Chinese):        100% translated (Beta Xiong)


You can edit the translations with Notepad, just open the corresponding po file of the language.
For example to edit the Japanese translation open the ....\Demos\Customizer\locale\ja\LC_MESSAGES\default.po file with Notepad and edit the msgstr entries.
You can also use PoEdit (http://poedit.sourceforge.net) to edit the files.

To create a new translation for a different language use the default.po file template located in the locale directory.

If you improve one of the translations please send it to me, my email address is here:
